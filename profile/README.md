# Welcome to FPGASystemsLab

## Overview

Welcome to FPGASystemsLab, a collaborative research initiative focused on developing cutting-edge FPGA solutions. Our projects span a wide range of applications, from advanced network-on-chip (NoC) architectures like RingNet to high-performance microprocessors such as ECO32. Alongside these cornerstone projects, we also explore multi-processor structures, interface implementations for video, Ethernet, and other I/O devices, and development tools tailored for our ecosystem.

## Main Repositories

- **[RingNet: Advanced NoC Architecture](https://github.com/FPGASystemsLab/src.rbus)**: A groundbreaking network-on-chip architecture designed for optimal FPGA utilization, featuring innovative routing, switching, and data handling mechanisms.
- **[ECO32 Microprocessor](https://github.com/FPGASystemsLab/src.eco32_core)**: A highly efficient, RISC architecture microprocessor, custom-built for FPGA environments, supporting a diverse range of computing tasks with exceptional performance.

## Auxiliary Repositories

Our organization also hosts a variety of auxiliary repositories that support simulations, multi-processor structures based on RingNet, and implementations of various I/O interfaces such as video and Ethernet. Additionally, we provide an assembler based on YASM code, alongside libraries and assembler tools for the ECO32 processor.
- **[I/O interfaces](https://github.com/FPGASystemsLab/src.dev)**: The I/O repository is an extensive collection of modules, crafted to seamlessly integrate with both the Eco32 Microprocessor project and the RingNet NoC project. Among these modules are essential communication and interface components such as UART, SPI, I2C, and SD cards, alongside keyboards and VGA interfaces. Each module is engineered with compatibility and flexibility in mind, ensuring that developers can easily incorporate them into their Eco32 or RingNet-based systems. This not only enhances the project's modular architecture but also significantly expands its potential applications, ranging from embedded systems to complex computing environments requiring sophisticated input and output capabilities.
