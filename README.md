# Welcome to FPGASystemsLab

## Overview

Welcome to FPGASystemsLab, a collaborative research initiative focused on developing cutting-edge FPGA solutions. Our projects span a wide range of applications, from advanced network-on-chip (NoC) architectures like RingNet to high-performance microprocessors such as ECO32. Alongside these cornerstone projects, we also explore multi-processor structures, interface implementations for video, Ethernet, and other I/O devices, and development tools tailored for our ecosystem.

## Main Repositories

- **[RingNet: Advanced NoC Architecture](https://github.com/FPGASystemsLab/RingNet)**: A groundbreaking network-on-chip architecture designed for optimal FPGA utilization, featuring innovative routing, switching, and data handling mechanisms.
- **[ECO32 Microprocessor](https://github.com/FPGASystemsLab/ECO32)**: A highly efficient, RISC architecture microprocessor, custom-built for FPGA environments, supporting a diverse range of computing tasks with exceptional performance.

## Auxiliary Repositories

Our organization also hosts a variety of auxiliary repositories that support simulations, multi-processor structures based on RingNet, and implementations of various I/O interfaces such as video and Ethernet. Additionally, we provide an assembler based on YASM code, alongside libraries and assembler tools for the ECO32 processor.
